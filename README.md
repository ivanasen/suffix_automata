# Suffix Automata
A program implementing the smallest automaton recognizing the suffixes of a word discussed in the paper by A. Blumer, J. Blumer and D. Haussler "The smallest automaton recognizing the subwords of text". The algorithm achieves O(n) time and O(n) space where n is the length of the word.
